<h2>Public Transport: Buses</h2>

<UL>
<IMG SRC="pics/photos/Youngs_Bus.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=30%>

<p><LI> Young's <b>Route 20 Bus</b> runs from <b>Rockhampton Airport</b>,
to Rockhampton Base Hospital, East St Mall, Rockhampton Shopping Fair, and numerous other stops,
and then onto Yeppoon, and through beach side towns to a bus stop about 100 m (100 yards) from the front of Kinka Palms.

<p><LI> This same <b>Route 20 Bus</b> also runs to Emu Park, Zilzie, Rosslyn Bay Harbour / Marina, and
other sea-side locations between Emu Park and Yeppoon, and it also stops at several large shopping
centers in Rockhampton and Yeppoon.

<p><LI> The bus journey from Rockhampton to Kinka Palms takes about 1 hour (depends on time of day and where you board the bus in Rockhampton).

<p><LI> Please
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youngsbusservice.com.au/timetables"> click here to see all Young's Buses timetables</a>.
Note: you need to catch a <b>Route 20 Bus</b> to travel between Rockhampton, Yeppoon, Emu Park, and Kinka Palms Motel.

<p><LI> Or, for other bus times and details, please see visit
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youngsbusservice.com.au"> Young's Buses web site.</a>

<h2>Public Transport: Trains</h2>

<UL>
<IMG SRC="pics/photos/tilt_train_624x147.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=40%>

<p><LI> The nearest train station to Kinka Palms is <b>Rockhampton Train Station</b>, which is approximately 45 Km away.
To travel between Kinka Palms and Rockhampton Train Station, you can do one of the following:
<OL>
<p><LI> Catch Young's Bus Shuttle Service.  According to an email I received from Youngs (22-July-2014):
<p>
<i>If your guests are arriving on the Tilt Train from Brisbane, we provide a train link service for Queensland Rail which will collect your passengers from the station and take them to Kinka Beach (every day except Wednesday). This service needs to be booked through Queensland Rail Travel Train on <b></i>1800 872 467<i></b>. They send us a manifest on the evening prior as to what passengers will be travelling. This service will wait for the passengers if the train is late. It normally arrives at the railway station at 6.25pm and travels to Emu Park via Yeppoon, so passengers can disembark at Kinka Beach. It is scheduled to depart Rosslyn Bay at 7.25pm and will arrive at Kinka Beach not long after that time. They will need to let the driver know where they wish to get off.  If they are arriving on a different service, it is probably best to catch a taxi from the railway station to Bolsover Street (outside the Police Station between Fitzroy and Denham Streets) as it is quite a distance to walk. There is no shuttle bus that I am aware of.</i>
<p>
NOTE: you can actually book the train from Brisbane to Kinka Beach and the train link shuttle bus service will be included in your ticket price - nothing more to pay.  :)

<p><LI> Or, catch a taxi or a local Rockhampton bus between the Young's Bolsover St stop and the Rockhampton train station and then take the Young's <b>Route 20 Bus</b> between Bolsover St Rockhampton and Kinka Beach (see above).  (It is only a few Km between the Rockhampton train station and Young's <b>Route 20 Bus</b> Bolsover St stop).

<p><LI> Or, make use of another shuttle bus service, such as
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.littlejohnnystours.com/"> Little Johnny's Tours</a> (Ph. (0414) 793 637) who do Rockhampton Train Station and Rockhampton Airport transfers to/from Kinka Palms, as well as guided tours of local attractions.  The price (as of June-2014) for transfers is approximately $100 each way for up to 4 people.

<p><LI> Or, hire a car - see the <a href="region__car_hire.html">Car Hire</a> section of our web site.

<p><LI> Or, take a taxi all the way (approximately $150-200 each way).  :)
