<h2>Pet Friendly: Information and Responsibilities</h2>

<UL>
<IMG SRC="pics/photos/Kinka_Palms_Pet_Supplies__SAM_3203s2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=30%>

<p><LI> We are <b>"pet friendly" / "dog friendly" / "cat friendly"</b> for clean, well behaved adult pets only.

<p><LI> Our goal is to ensure that everyone at Kinka Palms has a peaceful, relaxing, and enjoyable stay.

<p><LI> Only three (3) of our 13 apartments are designated <b>PET FRIENDLY</b> - they are located on the ends of the building wings for easy access to the
large lawn areas behind the motel and where there is less passing traffic.

<p><LI>  Our other ten (10) apartments are strictly <b>NO PETS ALLOWED</b>.
Pets are strictly <b>NOT ALLOWED</b> inside any of our <b>NO PETS ALLOWED</b> apartments under any circumstances.
Steep cleaning fees and other penalties (such as possible eviction) apply to anyone who fails to observe this rule.

<p><LI> Pets cost an extra <B>$10 AUD per pet per night</B>.
This charge goes towards performing additional cleaning and pest control activities in our pet friendly apartments.

<p><LI> We can provide pet towels, pet bowls, and pet bedding if these are required.  Most people come prepared to cover all of their pet's needs, but just in case, we can supply these items.

<p><LI> We do *not* accept puppies or kittens or any other young animals nor any old or incontinent animals, except under very specific circumstances.
e.g. you have stayed with us lots of times in the past and we know you will do the right thing and pay proper attention to your pet, or
because you have paid a suitable bond to cover any extra cleaning that may be required.

<p><LI> The owner(s) of the pet(s) are solely responsible for their pets, not us.  Under no circumstances will we accept any responsibility for your pets.

<p><LI> If you intend bringing your pet(s), then please make sure that you request a "pet friendly" apartment at the time of booking,
and tell us how many pets you intend to bring.  A maximum of <b>2 pets</b> is allowed in each pet friendly apartment.

<p><LI> Dog owners are, of course, expected to cleanup after their dog around Kinka Palms Motel.
<b>Poopa Scoops</b> are provided at numerous locations around Kinka Palms Motel
and in the plant pots outside our designated pet friendly apartments,
to make it very easy for you to cleanup after your doggie while staying at Kinka Palms Motel.

<p><LI> We also have designated areas for your doggie to toilet: the large grass area beyond behind the motel, and
the large grass area between the pool and the road.  i.e.  please do not toilet your doggie around the BBQ area or picnic tables.
Note: you still need to supervise and clean-up after your dog in these designated toilet areas.

<b>Poopa Scoops</b> are provided at numerous locations around Kinka Palms Motel
and in the plant pots outside every designated pet friendly apartment,
to make it very easy for you to cleanup after your doggie while staying at Kinka Palms Motel.

<p><LI> Our pet friendly apartments are very popular.  We recommend you book in advance to avoid disappointment.
