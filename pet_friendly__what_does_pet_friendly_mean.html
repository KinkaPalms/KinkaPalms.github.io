<h2>What does "Pet Friendly" mean ?</h2>
<UL>
<IMG SRC="pics/photos/Hank__SAM_3296s2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=30%>

<p><LI> We are pet friendly, all staff here love animals, and Kinka Palms is a great place for people to come and stay with their clean, well behaved pets.  The emphasis is on people <b>coming and staying with their pets</b>.  We are *not* a kennel and we do not provide kennel facilities.  We do not want aggressive, savage, bitie, or barkie dogs coming here.

<p><LI> <b>Staying With Your Pet:</b> Most people bring their house pet with them, who are used to being inside with their owner, and it is these pets that we especially cater for.  However, occasionally someone might bring their outdoor dog(s) with them, and they keep them outside, on the veranda area or tied to their car or a tree on the grass area at the side or rear of their apartment.  We don't provide any kennel or other facilities for outdoor dogs, and for good reasons, see below.

<p><LI> <b>Considerate Behaviour:</b> We expect people to control their pets and to be considerate of other motel guests (who may or may not have pets) at all times.  Do not allow your dog to run around the motel unsupervised.  Also, do not let your dog run up to, approach, or jump on other motel guests or visitors.  If your dog might do this, then please keep your dog under control and on a leash.  Control your dog if they start barking.  A playful bark or 2 is fine.  However, barking that goes on for any longer length of time is unacceptable because it would certainly annoy other people and cause them to complain or check out or shorten their stay.

<p><LI> <b>No Dog Or Cat Flaps:</b> None of our apartments have dog or cat flaps on the doors, because we do NOT want your pet running around outside your apartment without your proper supervision.  We expect you to pay proper attention to your pets and to regularly take them outside to toilet them in the appropriate areas.  e.g. large grass area behind the motel, see below.

<p><LI> <b>Clean-up:</b> We expect you to cleanup after your pet (scoop their poop, etc), and we expect you to supervise and keep your pets under control at all times so that they are not disturbing or infringing on other guests, or going to the toilet unsupervised.

<p><LI> <b>Designated Toilet Areas:</b>
There is a large grass area behind the motel and there is another large grass area on between the roadside of the pool and the road, and it is in these areas that we expect people to toilet their pets.
Do NOT toilet your pets around the BBQ area or around the picnic tables or near other guests.

<p><LI> <b>No Dog Yard:</b> There is <b>NO</b> dog yard or fenced area at Kinka Palms.  We have thought long and hard about putting a dog yard and dog house (at the rear of the motel - behind the pet friendly apartments).  However, we have worried about what could happen if a dog is left unsupervised in a fenced yard: barking, biting a child who wanders over to fence, escaping and running away, getting bitten by a snake, tipping their water bowl over and becoming dehydrated, and so on.  We are certainly not saying your dog is a barker or a biter, and we certainly are not suggesting that there are lots of snakes around here.  The vast majority of dogs who stay at the motel are lovely dogs (with lovely owners), but there have been a few not-so-good ones (a few not-so-good owners), and unfortunately we need to consider everyone when thinking about these sorts of topics.

<p><LI> <b>Veranda:</b> All of our apartments have veranda areas at the front, and you are welcome to sit with your doggie on the veranda with you in front of your apartment.  However, expect people and children to be walking around, past your apartment, backwards and forwards to the pool, etc, and be ready to restrain your dog if they attempt to run to people.  Not everyone who visits the motel is friendly towards pets.  Some people don't like dogs at all, and their space needs to be properly respected.  Also, please ensure that your pet doesn't enter any other apartments.  Most of our apartments are strictly "no pets allowed", because so many people have allergies, etc to pets, and quite a few people say "I don't want an apartment a dog has been in".   We must be able to look people in the eye and say "a pet has never been in that apartment".  If your pet enters a non-pet friendly apartment, even for a few seconds, then substantial cleaning will be required to restore the apartment to its pristine state, and you will be charged for this cleaning.

<p><LI> <Barkie Dogs:</b> A barkie dog left unsupervised can create a great deal of noise and cause major problems and complaints from everyone else staying with us.  This can disrupt the peace and amenity for other guests and make things very unpleasant for other guests.  We cannot and will not let this happen.

<p><LI> Motels tend to be busy places, people coming and going, doors opening and closing, kids playing, etc and we have seen some dogs who cannot settle in such an environment.  Leaving a very quite, old indoor dog who settles well and is used to being on their own might be OK for an hour.  However, leaving any dog locked inside the apartment for hours or more would be cruel.  Leaving "barkie" or destructive dogs locked in the apartment on their own for any length of time is a definite no, no.

<p><LI> Our philosophy is that Kinka Palms is a great place for people to come and holiday with their pets - and stay with their pets - and not dump them or leave them on their own for the day and somehow expect us to keep an eye on them, manage them, or keep them under control.

<p><LI> The owner(s) of the pet(s) are solely responsible for their pets, not us.  Under no circumstances will we accept any responsibility for your pets.

<p><LI> If you do need to leave your pet on its own, then
<a target=_blank href="http://www.yeppoonboardingkennels.com.au/"> Yeppoon Boarding Kennels and Cattery</a>
(546 Farnborough Road, Yeppoon  Queensland 4703, Ph: (07) 4939 7593,
<a target=_blank href="http://www.yeppoonboardingkennels.com.au/"> http://www.yeppoonboardingkennels.com.au/</a>,
Email:
<a href="mailto:yeppoonkennels@gmail.com">yeppoonkennels@gmail.com</a>)
can mind your dog or cat for hours, days, or weeks, in a very nice and clean environment, and
give the pet meals for a very reasonable $15-17 per day (last time we checked).
We have heard very positive reports from guests who left their pets at
<a target=_blank href="http://www.yeppoonboardingkennels.com.au/"> Yeppoon Boarding Kennels and Cattery</a>.
Perhaps they offer discounts for multiple doggies or multiple days ?

<p><LI> <b>Potential Problems ?</b>
If your dogs are barkie or may bite, or if they are in any way aggressive or bitie, or if you intend to leave them here unsupervised while you go off for hours or the entire day, or if you cannot be bothered to supervise, control, or cleanup after your dog, then please do <b>NOT</b> book with us.  We are definitely not set-up for this, and we can do without people who don't give proper consideration to other motel guests.
