<h2>WEB Page Updates / News: </h2>
<UL>

<P><LI> <b>15-May-2021: New WEB Host:</b>
Our old web host has closed without warning ... another victim of this rotten Covid-19 pandemic ...
Move to a new web host.  Our web page is now: https://kinkapalms.github.io/
</LI></P>


<P><LI> <b>15-May-2021: Farewell Twin Apartment S3:</b>
Remove all references to our <b>"Twin Apartment S3 (sleeps 1-3 people)"</b> apartment.
This apartment has been converted to a
<a href="media__photos__Kinka_Palms_Motel_Inside_Double_Apartment.html">Double Apartment S2 (sleeps 1-2 people)</a>
apartment.
</LI></P>

<P><LI> <b>15-May-2021: Increase our Peak Rates</b>
 from $140 --> $160 per night for a Double Studio S2 apartment (off peak), with similar increases for our other apartments.
We have been forced to do this because we are finding that people are staying for short periods during Peak Times.
Example: 20 years ago, our motel would be booked out for 14 or more nights over Christmas / New Year, because everyone loved to have a nice, long holiday break.
Nowadays, everyone only wants to say between Christmas / New Year.
We have to make hay while the sunshines, and if the sun is shining for a shorter period of time, then we have to charge more.
Sorry folks, there's no other choice.
</LI></P>

<P><LI> <b>16-Dec-2020: Price increase:</b>
 $105 --> $120 per night for a Double Studio S2 apartment (off peak), with
similar increases across the board for other apartments and seasons.
Cannot keep prices low because so many people insist on behaving badly, without any regard for others.
If people want lower prices, they need to learn to behave properly and respect other people and their property.
</LI></P>

<P><LI> <b>1-Nov-2020: Limit Booking.com and Charge a $$$ Premium:</b>
We have greatly reduced our apartment types and nights available on the Booking.com web site because we are finding
that almost all of the badly behaved, rude, obnoxious people we encounter have booked via Booking.com.  And it is these people that have the gall to leave rotten, fraudulent, revenge "reviews" about us because <b>they</b> behaved so badly.
Spoken to many other motels and hotels about the bad behaviour of Booking.com people, and they all confirm this.
We also charge Booking.com bookings a premium of $10-20 per night because of their bad behvaiour and bad attitude.
If the behaviour of Booking.com people continues to degenerate, then we will turn off bookings via them completely.  Life's too short !
<br>
We want everyone to have a lovely peaceful stay.  We don't want people coming here and causing friction or disturbances or problems for other guests or staff.  If you want to do that, go stay somehwere else.
<br>
Note: The people who book directly with us, and of course our lovely regular customers, are a much better class of person.  The difference really is night and day.

Lovely warm weather here.  Nice cool nights and hot days with cool sea breezes in the afternoons.

<P><LI> <h3>25-Feb-2015: Tropical Cyclone Marcia and Business as Usual</h3>
The cyclone hit us 6 days ago (around lunchtime on Fri, 20-Feb-2015) with winds gusting up to 285 Km/hour (180 miles/hour). It sure was a beast of a storm. The storm roared like a jumbo jet.  Since the day of the cyclone, there's been nothing but gentle breezes and glorious blue skies.
<p>
We suffered only very minor damage (an awning and garden shed damaged).  The power and phone are now back on, everything is
cleaned up and it's business as usual now.
<IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif">
</p>
<p>
As soon as we got power and phone back on, I put a sign out the front of the motel (see the picture on the right) offering free phone and laptop charging, free wireless internet, and free hot showers to all others in the community who need help and/or don't have their power back on yet.
</p>
<p>
I'd specially like to thank everyone who has emailed and phoned us to see how we are coping and for thinking of us during challenging times !

- to our web site, and also add the plan / design to each page containing
<a href="media__photos__Kinka_Palms_Motel_Inside_Double_Apartment.html">photographs inside each type of apartment</a>.
These plans make it very easy for people to understand the layouts of each type of apartment.

Upload
<a href="media__photos__Kinka_Beach.html">28 photographs</a> of Kinka Beach,
Kinka Palms Motel apartment interiors and exteriors, grounds, pool, etc.
These are all amateur photographs that I took with my digital camera today or very recently.
Various web site tweaks, such as improving navigation.

<P><LI> <b>6-Sep-2013:</b>
Completely redesign and redevelop our web site.  New page banner, new layout, new design, new colour scheme, new everything.
<IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif">
This was a great deal of work.
Our old web site received a lot of very positive feedback over the years from guests - everything was on 1 long page and was so easy to find and print, etc.
However, it was old fashioned and very basic.
Our new web site is sleek, clean, and very professional.
Pictures coming soon (within the next few days in all goes well).

<P><LI> <b>5-Sep-2013:</b>
Update our <a href="customer_testimonials.html"> 	Customer Testimonials</a> with our latest customer feedback from our Guest Book, Take-A-Break, Stayz, and so on.
<IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif">
We no longer provide Continental Breakfasts.
Add a page counter to the end of our web page.
Make our web site's pages fully scaleable - so you can view and read our web site easily and properly on Tablets, mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, etc.
Remove the "<b>Champions Brock Experience</b>" from the
<a href="region__local_attractions.html"> Links and Local Attractions</a>
section (they more or less closed down a couple of years ago, but their signs were still up, and we hoped they would re-open again and rise from the ashes, so I kept their link on our web page just in case ...  But, sadly, they are closed for good).

<P><LI> <b>15-Jan-2013:</b>
Update our <a href="customer_testimonials.html"> 	Customer Testimonials</a> with our latest customer feedback from our Guest Book, Take-A-Break, Stayz, and so on.

<P><LI> <b>20-Jul-2011:</b> Update the "spectacular views of the Keppel Bay islands and ocean" description to reflect
the incredible growth of vegetation, that is blocking our views, across the road.

<P><LI> <b>7-Jul-2011:</b> Update our
<a href="accommodation__room_rates_pricing.html"> Room Rates</a>
by $10 per night.
This is a very modest price rise and well below increases in rates, insurance, electricity, etc.
This is our first price rise in almost 3 years (1-Oct-2008).
<P><LI> <b>7-Jul-2011:</b> Update our <a href="customer_testimonials.html"> 	Customer Testimonials</a> with our latest customer feedback.

<P><LI> <b>20-Feb-2011:</b> Update our new
<a href="accommodation__cancellation_policy.html">	Cancellation Policy</a>: This is a lot tougher than our old cancellation policy.
We have been forced to toughen up our <a href="accommodation__cancellation_policy.html">	Cancellation Policy</a> because
of the "blood bath" of cancellations we suffered over recent Christmas-New Year peak and the recent
surf carnival.

<P><LI> <b>8-Feb-2011:</b>
Following the recent Surf Carnival, we have now removed all bunk beds from our apartments.
So, our Family Apartment-S6 is now no more.  Our apartment that sleeps the most people is now a
"Family Apartment-S5": Studio apartment with 2 Rooms -
1 x double bed and 1 x single bed in one separate bedroom, and
2 x single beds in main room (with TV, kitchen, etc).

Update <a href="customer_testimonials.html"> 	Customer Testimonials</a> with the latest customer feedback.
<IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif">
Make some minor clarifications to our
<a href="accommodation__cancellation_policy.html">	Cancellation Policy</a>: change "might" to "risk" and add in the phrase "especially if we had "no vacancy" for the days involved".
Add clarifications for our "pet friendly" apartments: make it clear that we only have 2 "pet friendly" apartments,
and that these are the only apartments that pets are allowed in, and suggest booking in advance to avoid disappointment.
Update the references to "TV" to include "digital TV set top box".
