<p><LI> Thank you guys for a great stay over the weekend. Wonderful weekend and we will be back in the near future.<br><i>Gerry, Dysart, October 2013.<br>(Source: Email</a>)</i>
<p><LI> Why I love this place is because it doesn't matter who you are by wealth or status, you are always treated as a valued friend.  As guests we have our own space, the BBQ, our own veranda areas, the swimming pool, and there is ample parking spaces.  The motel has a lovely, friendly village atmosphere that welcomes everyone and encourages people to meet new friends.  In my industry, I meet people from all walks of life and give respect to people who give respect to others.  I have stayed at Kinka Palms many times, for up to 3 months at a time, and I keep coming back to stay here again and again, and I have come to think of Kinka Palms as my second home, and because of the friendships I have with other guests who stay here regularly as well.  The service is always great.  If we want privacy as we stay for a week or more, we can look after ourselves and seek service from motel staff whenever we need it.  Also, I am a pet lover.  I know motel staff pets and friends who stay here with their pets very well.  How much better can a second home be ?  Kind Regards,<br><i>Rob Curby, Calliope, October 2013.<br>(Source: Email</a>)</i>

<p><LI> Had a lovely time staying in Kinka. A great place for people with dogs. The owners were very welcoming and made our stay comfortable.  The beach across the road was beautiful and the dogs enjoyed a swim every second day. The location was good with shops and restaurants close by. A great place to recharge your batteries.

<p><LI> Thank you very much … for the enjoyable stay, especially with the beach so close.  With best wishes,<br><i>Bob Sullings, Tannum Sands QLD,  July 2009.<br>(Source: Thank You Card</a>)</i>
<p><LI> Just wanted to say a HUGE thanks for having us at Unit 6 on Saturday night (14/2).  We had the absolute best time & Lonhro really enjoyed his first ever holiday!! <IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif">  You guys are so wonderful to open up a room as “Pet Friendly” - having said that, the room is so immaculate that you would have no idea that it was the designated Pet Friendly quarters!!  It is a very unique service you offer & we have told all of our pet-loving friends about it.  We will be back – with the fur child & new baby soon!!  Take Care, <br><i>Chris, Jane & Lonhro, Rockhampton,  Qld,  February 2009.<br>(Source: Email</a>)</i>
<p><LI> Best break away, "Best friendliest Murray".  What a hero.  Should be given a bravery medal.  Thankyou.<br><i>Jo & Kirsty Neylan xxx, Home Hill, Qld, February 2009.<br>(Source: Guest Comments Book in Reception</a>)</i>
<p><LI> Very enjoyable 9 night stay with wonderfully humble place with a terrific pool and warm beds. Was such a relief to find a clean and quiet place to share with our pets. Murray is one of the champions who cleans the units and maintains the yards. We found him lovely, approachable and very effecient in his job, who just loves animals. Thankyou all for a truely lovely stay...i recommend this place as a list topliner when looking for a place to stay in and around Yeppoon.

<p><LI> 9 days - Wonderful !  I feel that I've had a true break.  Mike & Murray are the most gracious hosts.  Will recommend to all.  <IMG SRC="pics/smilie.gif"><br><i>Wayne, QLD,  January 2009.<br>(Source: Guest Comments Book in Reception</a>)</i>
<p><LI> Murray and Mike: Thanks so much for looking after us !  The ice creams [in the freezer] are on us !  Thanks again :) <br><i>Meredith and Dave, Longreach  Qld,  January 2009.  <p><UL>UPDATE: Dave wrote a nice article about their stay: <a href="http://www.tismy.com/wordpress/2009/04/holidays-with-dogs/" target="_blank"> Holidays with Dogs</a> (April 6th, 2009).  Thank you for the lovely feedback, please come back and see us again soon !!  :)</UL><p><UL>Here's a short quote from <a href="http://www.tismy.com/wordpress/2009/04/holidays-with-dogs/" target="_blank"> Dave's Article</a>:<UL><p><LI>So, how did it go?  The short answer is that it was great!  Mike, the owner, and Murray, his off-sider, couldn’t have been more helpful.  Both were very easy going and really made the holiday the relaxing time that it was.  The rooms are not super-modern but very comfortable and have all the mod-cons you really need out of a relaxing holiday destination.  The location was superb with a short walk over the road and through the dunes to the beach.</UL></UL><br>(Source: Hand written note and Tis My Dot Com web site - see link above.</a>)</i>

<p><LI> The accommodation was very clean and tidy with extremely friendly staff.  The site is pet friendly and this is a huge bonus, as there are limited places that allow dogs.  The apartments are across the road from the beach, so they are in a wonderful location.
