<h2>Great Climate, Calm Ocean, and (virtually) No Jellyfish !!</h2>

<UL>

<LI> <b>Temperature and Rain:</b>
This part of the Australian coast is just inside the tropics - i.e. we are just north of the
<b>Tropic of Capricorn</b>.
As a result, we have a climate that we believe is <b>perfect for human habitation</b> -
we are not too hot and not too cold.
We also receive very little rain.
e.g. 90+ days out of 100 seem to have cloudless blue skies and gentle sea breezes most of the time, and
the temperature very rarely goes above <b>30°C (86°F)</b> or below <b>10°C (50°F)</b>.

<p>
People visit the beach and swim here all year round.
We hardly ever get cloudy days or rain, and storms are very rare.
<br>
In <b>Winter</b> (June-August), temperatures range from 12-22 degrees C (56-72 degrees F) approx.
Even in Winter, the vast majority of days are cloudless blue skies and sunshine here.
<br>
In <b>Summer</b>, temperatures range from 24-30 degrees C (75-85 degrees F) approx.
Ref: <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast"> Capricorn Coast (Wikipedia)</a>
</p>


<p><LI> <b>Waves and Currents:</b>
The ocean in this part of the coast is very gentle - almost all wave activity is blocked by <b>The Great Barrier Reef</b> and the <b>Keppel Islands</b>.
As a result, we do not get large / rough seas, big waves, or strong currents.
The ocean is very safe for snorkeling and swimming for adults and children.
However, if you are not a good swimmer, please swim between the flags on
beaches patrolled by Life Savers, such as Emu Park and Yeppoon Beaches.

<p><LI> <b>Cyclones:</b>
<IMG SRC="pics/photos/Stingers_sign_SAM_3711s.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=20%>
The last cyclone we had in this area was in 1990, more than 23 years ago.
Most cyclones seem to miss this part of the coast, striking further north (around Townsville or Cairns) or further south (around the Sunshine Coast / Gold Coast area).
However, even if a cyclone misses us by many 100's of Km, it can still cause strong winds and lots of rain in our region, and this can flood the lowest lying roads around Rockhampton and surrounding regions, making travel difficult.
This is one reason why we recommend that all travelers take out suitable
<a href="accommodation__cancellation_policy.html#Travel_Insurance">Travel and Cancellation Insurance</a>.
One trend we have noticed in recent years is the media (TV, Radio, newspapers, etc)
love to beat up a storey and make it seem much larger than it really is.
For example, if the lowest lying parts of Rockhampton flood (because they are built on a flood plain and therefore naturally flood during times of heavy rain and high tides), then the media will make it seem like the whole of Rockhampton is 10 feet underwater.  And, if a cyclone is heading for Cairns (more than 1,000 Km north of us), then the media will make it seem like all of Queensland is being battered by the cyclone.
Keep this in mind when travelling.

<p><LI> <b>Jelly fish:</b>
In Summer months (November-March) you do need to be aware of the box jelly fish.  People have been stung around here, but it is a very rare occurrence.  Further north, you have to be very careful in summer months.
Jelly fish, marine stingers, etc also seem to be very rare around here, even in the middle of summer.
Further north, in Airlie Beach, Cairns, etc you have to be very careful in summer.
However, we just don't seem to get many nasties around here.
I've been living here since 1996, and have only
heard of a few local jellyfish sting cases in all that time.
(It is always best to play it safe though, especially in summer - see sign on the right).

<p><LI> You will see "<b>Beware of Stingers</b>" signs on the entrances to the most popular beaches
on the Capricorn Coast, see sign on the right.
While these signs seem to be erring on the side of caution,
it is always best to play it safe during summer months (between November and March), even though stingers seem to be very rare around here.
